# What is ATS?

In today's competitive job market, crafting a resume that stands out is essential to catch the attention of potential employers. But did you know that your resume often has to pass through a digital gatekeeper before a human even sees it? This gatekeeper is known as an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).

Throughout this guide, we will dive into the nitty-gritty details of creating an ATS-friendly resume that not only pleases the software but also effectively showcases your qualifications to potential employers.

### How ATS works?

ATS software scans and parses resumes submitted by applicants. It breaks down the information into sections, such as contact details, work experience, education, and skills. The parsed data is then stored in a database, which recruiters can search and filter based on specific criteria. Here's a simplified breakdown of the ATS process:

1. **Parsing:** ATS software extracts text from resumes and organizes it into structured data fields. This process involves identifying headers, bullet points, and other formatting elements.
2. **Keyword Matching:** The system matches the keywords from the job description with those in the resume. Resumes with a higher keyword match percentage are often ranked higher.
3. **Ranking and Scoring:** Resumes are assigned scores based on various factors such as keyword relevance, work experience, education, and more. Recruiters often review resumes in descending order of their scores.
4. **Filtering:** Recruiters can filter resumes based on criteria like years of experience, education level, location, and specific skills.
5. **Communication:** Some ATS software also facilitate communication between recruiters and candidates, storing correspondence and interview schedules.
