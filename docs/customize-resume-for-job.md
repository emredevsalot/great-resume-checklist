# Customize your resume to each job application - Keyword Optimization

Keywords play a pivotal role in the ATS process. When you submit your resume, the ATS scans it for keywords that match the job description. The more closely your resume aligns with the keywords, the higher your chances of making it through the initial screening process.

Customizing your resume for each job application is vital. Create a master resume that lists all your skills and experiences, and then tailor it for each specific position by emphasizing the keywords relevant to that job. You can do that by using Prompt Filler.
