# Resume Structure

When it comes to creating an ATS-friendly resume, the way you structure your document is just as important as the content it contains. A well-organized resume not only improves readability for humans but also ensures that applicant tracking systems can parse and understand your information accurately. Follow these guidelines to structure your resume effectively:

## Name and contact information

Place your full name, job title, phone number, professional email address, LinkedIn profile and location at the top of your resume. Keep this information straightforward, using a standard font and a slightly larger font size than the rest of the text. ATS systems will often extract this information to create a profile for you.

Some ATS systems filter resumes based on exact job title in the posting. It's wise to follow this rule rather than using an alternative job title. This also means that you need to apply for jobs that match your skills and abilities accurately.

## Summary or objective

Immediately following your contact information, include a concise summary or objective statement that aligns with the job you're applying for. Tailor this section to include relevant keywords from the job description. This will grab both the ATS's attention and that of potential employers.

**Summary:** If you're an experienced professional with a strong track record, opt for a summary. This should be a concise overview of your skills, achievements, and experience, highlighting your unique value proposition.

**Objective:** If you're a recent graduate, career changer, or targeting a specific role, an objective might be more appropriate. State your career goals and intentions clearly.

If you’re coming from a different field, this is also your opportunity to explain how your skills and experiences from previous positions fit your new career path.

## Work Experience

List your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent position. Use a consistent format for each entry, including the job title, company name, dates of employment, and a brief description of your responsibilities and accomplishments.

Alongside role details, delve into the tools, software, and technical skills you employed to achieve success. This method aligns effectively with potential ATS keywords, particularly those mirrored in the job description. Spotlight distinctive accomplishments, quantifying outcomes when feasible to emphasize your influence. Tailor these achievements to match the targeted position's needs.

## Education

Provide your educational history, including degrees, majors, and the institutions you attended. Mention any honors, awards, or relevant coursework. If you're a recent graduate or still in school, your education section can hold more prominence. However, as you gain more professional experience, the emphasis will shift towards your work history.

You may also include bullet points describing relevant classes or projects within your education section if this experience was recent.

## Skills

List your relevant skills, both technical and soft. These can include specific software, languages, certifications, and interpersonal abilities. Use a clear format to ensure easy readability. ATS systems often scan this section for keywords related to the job requirements, so be sure to match your skills to the job description.

## **TIP:** Consistent section headers

Ensure that your resume sections are appropriately and consistently labeled with titles such as "Work Experience," "Education," and "Skills." ATS systems depend on these headers to accurately identify and categorize the various segments of your resume. Utilizing uniform headings like these eliminates confusion for the ATS.

## **TIP:** Length and readability

Keep your resume length reasonable—ideally, it should not exceed two pages. Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and concise sentences to enhance readability. Remember that both humans and ATS systems appreciate clear, succinct information.

By following these guidelines for structuring your resume, you'll create a document that not only impresses human hiring managers but also successfully navigates the automated screening process of applicant tracking systems. Remember, a well-structured resume is your best tool to showcase your qualifications and make a lasting impression.
