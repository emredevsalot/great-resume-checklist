# Formatting

## Alignment, spacing and margins

Align your text to the left.

<!--
If you want to center your name, contact information etc. here’s how you can do that without aligning to the center.
<Show aligning to the center left aligned.> -->

When it comes to line spacing it’s best to keep it at 1 or 1.15x of your font.

<!--
In Google Docs you can achieve it by:
 <Google docs: Line & paragraph spacing>Single or 1.15> -->

You should have 0.5-1 inch margins across all sides of your resume. You can get to as low as 0.5 inch if your resume has a lot of content, but don’t go below that.

## Font family and font size

ATS-friendly fonts are common, easy to read fonts the ATS can correctly parse out the text on your resume.

These include Times New Roman, Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Calibri, Georgia, Cambria, Gill Sans, Garamond.

Generally font size should be between 10 and 12 points. It’s good to not go below 10 for readability.

## Don’t use complex elements

Many ATS can only read simple text and likely to have a hard time understanding elements below:

**headers, footers, columns, tables, images, charts, graphics, symbols**

## Use bolding and italics strategically

Use bold and italic formatting sparingly to draw attention to key information. This can help your resume stand out to both ATS systems and human recruiters. However, don't overdo it; excessive formatting can actually hinder readability.

## Consistent Formatting

Recurring sections of your resume should have consistent formatting. For examples dates should be formatted in one of two ways: MM/YYYY or “March 2022”. Do not use the year only.

## Choosing the right file format

While PDFs usually keep your resume looking good, not all ATS systems can handle them. ATS systems vary, and some don't work well with PDFs.

Always check the accepted file formats listed by the employer before you submit your resume. If they don't mention PDFs, go for a .doc or .docx version of your resume for ATS compatibility. This reduces the risk of any formatting or reading issues that PDFs might cause.

Remember, your aim is to get your resume through the ATS to the hiring manager, so following the specified file format increases the chances of success.
